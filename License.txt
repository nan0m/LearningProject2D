The artwork and audiofiles are taken from various sources (HomeWorld 2, and ARE to BE USED ONLY FOR LEARNING PURPOSES). I just wanted to look at something pretty 
while learning the game as it helped me with motivation. Sound files are taken from the Freelancer game. The logic is the same. Nothing in the game can be
used for any other reason than learning and practicing.
More artwork has been added by @sketchy_pigeon. Art belongs to him and is licensed to be used here.
